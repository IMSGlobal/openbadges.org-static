With Open Badges, people of all ages and backgrounds can demonstrate the skills they’ve gained through a wide variety of learning experiences. Recipients may be awarded Open Badges directly from Issuers or following an application process. 

<h2 class="title title-content">How to earn badges</h2>
Any organization can issue Open Badges, and the hundreds who are already offering badges are doing it in many different ways. That means there is no one way to earn a badge. Some Issuers award badges for completion of formal education programs; others award badges for simple participation. Sometimes you need to submit an application with evidence, and sometimes earning a badge happens after passing a quiz. 

<h3 id="quickstart" class="title title-secondary">Earn a quick badge:</h3>
You can get a quick start to your badge collection by earning a really simple badge.

<h2 class="title title-content" id="what-to-do">What can you do with a Badge once you’ve Earned it?</h2>

You can share badges across digital contexts including:

* Blogs, websites, ePortfolios, and professional networks;
* Job Applications;
* Social media sites - Twitter, Google+, Facebook, LinkedIn; and 
* Your email signature.

Open Badges can be used all in all these places, because they can be viewed as image files. But they have a lot more to them than your average kitten meme, because they're packed with verifiable metadata. It requires a special application that knows how to look for Open Badges metadata to extract and verify this information, and that's why Open Badges Backpack Services and Displayers exist.

Recipients can use the Mozilla Backpack or another Backpack to manage the badges they’ve earned. Within the Mozilla Backpack, Recipients can group badges into collections, share the collections, and choose whether to make them publicly discoverable. Similar features are available in other options.

Set up your [Mozilla Backpack](http://backpack.openbadges.org/) to start managing and sharing your badges across the web.

Other storage options include:

* [Open Badge Passport](https://openbadgepassport.com/)
* [Badgr](http://info.badgr.io/)
