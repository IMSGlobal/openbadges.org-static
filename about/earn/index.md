# **Get Started by Earning a Badge**

With Open Badges, people of all ages and backgrounds can demonstrate the skills they’ve gained through a wide variety of learning experiences. Recipients may be awarded Open Badges directly from Issuers or following an application process. 

Answer a few [questions](http://openbadges.learningassistant.com/) to earn a quick badge.

Earn Badges from Badge Alliance or Other Issuers 

### What to do with a Badge once you’ve Earned it 

You can share badges across digital contexts including:

+ Blogs, websites, and professional networks;

+ Social media sites - Twitter, Google+, Facebook, LinkedIn; and 

+ Your email signature. 

For badges requiring assessment, the Recipient may need to submit evidence in support of his/her application. The Issuer will then review the Recipient’s application, comparing the submitted evidence to the criteria for the badge. If the Issuer decides to award the badge, this will be communicated with the Recipient, who may have follow-up tasks. These include pushing the badge to a Backpack (a personal badge repository).

### Open Badges-Compatible Backpacks

Recipients can use the Mozilla Backpack or another Backpack to manage the badges they’ve earned. Within the Mozilla Backpack, Recipients can group badges into collections, share the collections, and choose whether to make them publicly discoverable.

Set up your [Mozilla Backpack](http://backpack.openbadges.org/) to start managing and sharing your badges across the web.

### Who’s Using Open Badges

[Badges in Action](http://www.reconnectlearning.org/case-studies) - A set of case studies looking at how badges are used to capture learning and achievements in higher education, professional training, and after-school programs. 

[10 Million Better Futures](http://www.10mbetterfutures.org/) - This [Clinton Global Initiative] (https://www.clintonfoundation.org/clinton-global-initiative/commitments/digital-badges-unlocking-two-million-better-futures) aimed to help 10 million workers and students succeed using Open Badges by 2016. #BadgeChatK12 co-founder Noah Geisel joined leaders in the initiative’s commitment to unlock two million better futures with digital badges. 

[Cities of Learning](https://www.lrng.org/) - The first citywide badging initiative, launched in Chicago in 2013, was so successful that six cities launched badge systems for learning in 2014. Eight cities were named winners in the 2016 LRNG City Challenge, receiving grants to begin networking learning opportunities in their communities.
