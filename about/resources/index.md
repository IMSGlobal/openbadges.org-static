# What’s an Open Badge?

## Definition

A “digital badge” is a visual symbol of recognition represented by a digital image file. Open Badges are portable and verifiable digital badges that comply with the Open Badges Specification, which defines a mechanism to embed specific metadata about educational achievements into digital badges. Open Badges can represent online and offline accomplishments, experiences, and skills from formal and informal settings. Each Open Badge is associated with an image and metadata, which provides information about the badge, its Recipient, the Issuer, and any applicable supporting evidence.

Badges may represent many different types of achievements and trust relationships:

+ Hard skills such as proficiency in a programming language
+ Soft skills like collaboration
+ Participation
+ Official certification
+ Authorization 
+ Community involvement
+ New skills and literacies not recognized by traditional education providers

Open Badges allow you to verify your achievements, competencies, and interests through credible organizations. This information is attached to a badge image file, hard-coding the metadata for future access and review.
 
Because the system is based on an open standard, Recipients can combine multiple badges from different Issuers to tell the complete story of their verifiable achievements—both online and off. These web-enabled tokens can be displayed wherever Recipients want them on the web, including social media and badge Backpacks. Badges can be shared for employment, education, or lifelong learning.

Anyone can Issue a badge, receive one, verify that a badge is real, or see the detailed evidence from the Issuer. Badges can be used to set goals, motivate behaviors, connect learning environments, and communicate success in many contexts.

Open Badges started as a collaborative project between MacArthur Foundation and the Mozilla Foundation and has continued to grow through an open, collaborative community of implementers. It’s designed, built, and backed by a broad community of contributors. Much of the software that implements Open Badges is available as open source. See tools and services »

The open specification means improvements are created through a multi-stakeholder perspective, where values like user choice and privacy are maintained as core features of the ecosystem. 

The Open Badges project at the Mozilla Foundation kicked off with the [Open Badges Working Paper by Erin Knight] (https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/5/59/OpenBadges-Working-Paper_012312.pdf), in collaboration with Peer 2 Peer University. It sketches out the promise of an open ecosystem of verifiable digital learning credentials.
