<h2 class="title title-content">Who Can Issue Badges?</h2>
Any individual or organization may award Open Badges. All they need to do is use a compatible service or application to define and award badges. See a list of compatible Open Badges issuing platforms [here](../participating-services). Common types of issuers include:

* After-school programs 
* Communities of practice 
* Educational institutions 
* Employers
* Event organizers 
* Government agencies 
* International credential assessment agencies
* Informal learning organizations
* Online courses and open courseware initiatives
* Professional associations 
* Teachers, tutors, coaches

<h3 class="title title-secondary">Do you want to award badges yourself?</h3>
See **[Get started Issuing Open Badges &raquo;](../../get-started/issuing-badges)** for loads of information on what technical steps it takes to issue badges, selecting tools to automate the process, badge system design, and how to operate an Open Badges program.

See **[Open Badges Services and Software &raquo;](../participating-services)**

<h2 class="title title-content" id="whoissuing">Who’s Issuing Open Badges?</h2>
Here is a list of organizations that have been identified by the Badge Alliance as issuers of Open Badges. It's not comprehensive, and if you don't see your organization or an issuer you know, please [contact](../../contact) the Badge Alliance so we can verify that they are awarding badges compliant with the [Open Badges Specification](https://openbadgespec.org/) and add them to the list.

Some Issuers will have just one badge system while others will have many. Some programs may be open to the general public, while others may be closed to members or commercial partners. While this list doesn't include hundreds of other schools, courses and organizations who have started to award Open Badges, it begins to represent the breadth and variety of the growing Open Badges ecosystem.
