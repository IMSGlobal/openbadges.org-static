Individuals and organizations can take part in the badges ecosystem in many roles. Here’s some ways to get started.

<h2 class="title title-content" id="issue">Issue Open Badges</h2>
Individuals and organizations can issue Open Badges to recognize the achievements of people in their communities. Issuers define digital badges to represent a wide variety of activities, from participating in an event to demonstrating a complex set of competencies. Issuers who want to give their badges weight and meaning can use software or services compatible with the Open Badges Specification, an open data standard for describing achievements and packaging them into portable and verifiable representations. 

A growing community of educators and communities are using Open Badges to recognize achievements. Many of them are offering opportunities for the public to earn Open Badges. A number are available. Check out [Participating Issuers, Platforms, and Services]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/participating-services) to see who’s using Open Badges in their programs already and to find free and low cost services to get started with your own badging program.

Do you learn in a community that hasn’t started using Open Badges yet? Send them a link to this page to get started, or ask us about how to share the benefits of Open Badges. [Contact the Badge Alliance »]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact)

<h3 class="title title-secondary">Badge System Design</h3>
In order to award badges, an Issuer needs to develop and enact a plan for offering them. Badge system design is rooted in understanding how badges come together to form a system. The design process needed to get started issuing badges involves the types of badges, how Recipients are intended to earn them, the criteria and assessment practices, how the badges will look, and more.

<h2 class="title title-content" id="display">Display Open Badges</h2>
Another role some participants fill in the Open Badges ecosystem is that of Displayer. Displayers present badges earned on behalf of Recipients, and are important for ensuring that badges are useful for Recipients who want to show them to badge Consumers interested in their qualifications, such as potential employers or collaborators. In order to make the verifiable, portable metadata in Open Badges available to Consumers, badges must be displayed from within a tool that understands Open Badges.

Several services and applications are available to help Recipients display and share their badges. Displaying means integrating Open Badges displayer tools with your website or learning how to build your own display-oriented tool.

<h2 class="title title-content" id="understand">Understand Open Badges</h2>

Much of badging is designed with Consumers in mind. Consumers are the people with whom badge Recipients share their achievements. Consumers may be education providers, individuals, employers, communities, or other groups that are looking for people who possess the skills or achievements symbolized by badges. 

When badges reach Consumers, every design decision made by their Issuers come together with the capabilities of the Recipient's selected Displayer or Backpack to shape how the Consumers understand the value of the badges. The Open Badges community also offers a number of tools, from documentation to displayers, verifiers, and directory services, that help Consumers understand Open Badges. But because Consumers may not know badges you might show them are Open Badges, it’s often best to present earned badges to a Consumer from within a tool that showcases their capabilities, but this page is also available to help Consumers understand badges on their own.
